Git repository containing Wednesday's activity for NS3 School 2022

## Summary of the lecture

Nuclear physics processes have powered the creation of elements since the Big
Bang. The creation of all chemical elements found in nature is called
nucleosynthesis and occurs within stars, stellar collisions, stellar explosions,
and many others.  Evidence of the nuclear physics involved in these events is
observed in the abundances of the chemical elements in the solar system. We will
present some of the nucleosynthesis processes found in nature and discuss how
nuclear physics properties (masses, binding energies, reaction rates) shape the
creation of elements and how those signatures can be observed. In the activity
you will have the opportunity to see the importance of some of those nuclear
physics properties in the creation of elements.


## Schedule

11:00 - 11:45 Lecture

11:45 - 12:00 Splitting up in groups to discuss and form questions about the recorded lecture

12:00 - 12:30 Q&A where every group will ask one question (more if we have time)

13:30 - 14:30 Introduction to the activity - background material

14:30 - 16:30 Activity

16:30 - 17:30 Final discussion
